  haikus:
    - The Ethereal Architect: |
        From the drift, a thought
        Navigating turning tides
        Swiftly, through the mist
    - Code in Motion: |
        Fingers dance on keys
        Logic flows like water's path
        Bugs dissolve like fog

Air:
  weight: 0.8
  haikus:
    - Mindful Creation: |
        Empty page awaits
        Thoughts take shape with patience
        Design becomes art
    - The Silent Teacher: |
        No words, just the work
        Each line speaks its purpose clear
        Silence holds the truth

Earth:
  weight: 0.4
  haikus:
    - Shifting Sands: |
        Sand shifts with the wind
        Formless, yet defined
        Each grain tells a story

Fire:
  weight: 0.3
  haikus:
    - Digital Harmony: |
        Bytes and thoughts align
        Chaos becomes structured grace
        Order from the void
